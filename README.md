# Project Title: 
Employee Management System
# Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to create a command line application that allows a user to acess a database and interact with it. The database includes three tables; department, role, and employees. The user can add, view, or update these tables all from the command line. A demo video of this application can be found in this repo.
